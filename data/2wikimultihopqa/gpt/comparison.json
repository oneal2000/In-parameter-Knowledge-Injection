He was also one of the main supports of Robert Gould, as well as John Oldmixon. He may have embraced the Puritan cause around 1695, and some of his old friends were disaffected by this change. Charles Gildon, Thomas Rymer, and John Dennis dedicated volumes of literary criticism to Sheppard, and John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester regarded Sheppard as the only critic he needed for his verses. In his last years, Sheppard was reported dead several times before he died. In 1694, Lord Godolphin heard a report that Sheppard had died, but Sheppard himself responded, saying that he was alive, but that he had suffered from \"the stone\" for twelve to fourteen years. In December 1697, he was again reported as dead. In July 1698, he was \"again\" reported as dead. He did die shortly afterward, but in 1768 a joking \"Annual Register\" announced that Sheppard was still alive, in good health, and 120 years old.",

He was born and died in Montgomery, Alabama. The Dauphin Island Bridge south of Mobile is formally named for him. The Gordon Persons Building is a six floor, 60,000 square foot state government office building in Montgomery. Persons built a successful business running electrical lines in rural Alabama( benefiting from Rural Electrification Administration contracts); in addition to financial gain, he also won considerable popularity. When running for office in 1950, Persons gained notoriety by touring the state in a helicopter( prompting one opponent to dub him\" the man from Mars\"). He won the Democratic nomination by defeating a crowded field that included former governor Chauncey Sparks. In office, his notable accomplishments included abolishing flogging in Alabama's prisons, advocating for the establishment of Alabama Public Television, and imposing speed limits on state highways. Persons largely accomplished his goal of having four years of\" no fighting,\" maintaining a truce among the various wings of the state Democratic Party. At the end of his term, Persons ordered the National Guard into Phenix City following the assassination of Attorney- General- elect Albert Patterson. After leaving office as governor, Persons never sought statewide public office again, although he did make an unsuccessful run for circuit judge late in life. Persons was an alumnus of Auburn University, though he attended for only one year. While at Auburn, Persons served as president of a student organization( known as the\" Boxcar Reds and Boxcar Blacks\") that traveled to away football games.",

These singles were later collected by the band on a self- released compilation album in 1997 entitled\" Another Fictionalized History\". Their single\" Cellophane\" was a minor college radio hit in the band's native Seattle, getting frequent airplay on KCMU( now KEXP). The band's sound was influenced by the works of Krautrock bands such as Can and Neu!, and their first album also bore some sonic resemblance to the sounds of early 1990s bands from the UK shoegaze scene. This mesh of krautrock, shoegaze, drone, space- rock, and experimental electronica helped the band forge a unique sound, which helped them stand apart from other active bands in the Seattle scene that were more grunge, metal, or indie- rock based. Their success in solidifying a unique sound however did not translate to album sales, and the band remained a relatively obscure act, with a small cult following. The band split in 1998, and Ritter and Brown recorded together as Fontanelle for a couple more years.",

            "Lee Mantle( December 13, 1851 November 18, 1934) was a United States Senator from Montana. Born in Birmingham, England, his mother converted to Mormonism and immigrated to the United States with her children; they settled at Salt Lake City, Utah in 1864. Upon arriving in Utah Territory and facing evidence that Mormon men were practicing polygamy, Mantle's mother came to believe that she had been deceived by the Mormon missionaries and she and her children renounced the LDS Church. Mantle attended a village school and moved to Idaho Territory in 1870, where he was a telegraph operator and stage agent. He moved to Butte, Montana in 1877 and became agent of the Wells- Fargo Express Co. He established the Inter Mountain, a daily Republican newspaper, in 1881 and served as alderman the same year. He was a member of the Territorial house of representatives in 1882, 1884, and 1888, and served as speaker in 1888; he was mayor of Butte in 1892 and many times chairman of local and State conventions. Lee Mantle was appointed to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy in the term commencing March 4, 1893, caused by the failure of the legislature to elect, but was not seated; he was then elected as a Republican to fill the vacancy and served from January 16, 1895 to March 3, 1899. In 1896, he switched parties and joined the Silver Republican Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1899, and organized and became chairman of the Silver Republican Party of Montana in 1896, but returned to the Republican Party in 1900.

In 1921, he moved to Los Angeles, California and died there in 1934; he was interred in Mount Moriah Cemetery, Butte."

            "Gideon Johnson Pillow (June 8, 1806 \u2013 October 8, 1878) was an American lawyer, politician, speculator, slaveowner, United States Army major general of volunteers during the Mexican\u2013American War and Confederate brigadier general in the American Civil War. Before his military career, Pillow practiced law and was active in Democratic Party politics. He was a floor leader in support of the nomination of fellow-Tennessean James K. Polk at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. In 1847, Pillow was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers to serve in the Mexican\u2013American War, and was later promoted to major general. He performed reasonably well, and was wounded that year at Cerro Gordo and Chapultepec. However, controversy arose when, in a series of letters, Pillow tried to take what was perceived by some as undue credit for American victories at the expense of his commander, Major General Winfield Scott. Pillow was court-martialed for insubordination, but with President Polk's assistance, the court-martial was reduced to a court of inquiry, which in 1848 exonerated Pillow. After the war, Pillow served as a delegate to the Nashville Convention of 1850, where he supported compromise. He remained active in supporting the Democratic Party. At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Pillow supported secession, and was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army in July. Pillow received the thanks of the Confederate Congress for driving off the Union force at the Battle of Belmont, Missouri. Pillow controversially failed to exploit a temporary break through of Union lines by his troops which might have allowed the Confederate garrison of Fort Donelson to escape at the Battle of Fort Donelson on February 15, 1862. The next night, before the surrender of the fort, Brigadier General John B. Floyd passed overall command of the fort to Pillow, who in turn passed it to Brigadier General Simon Buckner. Floyd and Pillow managed to personally escape with a few aides before Buckner surrendered the remaining garrison to the Union Army of Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant.

            "The Catheters were a punk rock band from Bellevue, Washington, which formed in 1995 as a 4- piece with singer Brian Standeford, guitarist Derek Mason, bassist Paul Waude, and drummer James Lysons( who was soon replaced by Davey Borozowski of the band Damaged Goods). They originally played hardcore punk in the vein of bands such as Black Flag and The Circle Jerks. In 1998 they added second guitarist Lars Swenson and began cultivating a dirtier' 70s glam- rock sound, as heard on their eMpTy Records releases. The records sold fairly well and gained them the attention of larger labels such as DreamWorks and Sub Pop, the latter of whom signed the band to a recording contract in 1999. Over the course of their career they did extensive roadwork, touring North America and Europe with bands such as Sparta, Mudhoney, Run Run Run, Division of Laura Lee, and, often, the Murder City Devils. Waude and Swenson left the band in 2001 for other projects, and the Catheters continued as a 4- piece with longtime roadie Leo Gebhardt joining as bassist. In 2002, with the help of a popular music video, they scored an indie hit with the song\" Nothing\", from their album\" Static Delusions and Stone- Still Days\"( Sub Pop, 2002). After releasing more singles and touring heavily in 2002 and 2003, the band released the acclaimed album\" Howling ... It Grows and Grows !!!\" ( Sub Pop, 2004), which infused their earlier sound with elements of classic rock. The Catheters played their final show on October 15, 2004 at Seattle's Sunset Tavern, joined by friends the Vells and blackbelt( who played some old- school Catheters covers), ending the show with a mass sing- along to their song'\" Fake ID\" which degenerated into instrument destruction and a minor brawl. The band dissolved amicably, with Brian Standeford and Davey Borozowski forming the group Tall Birds( later joined by Leo Gebhardt), while Derek Mason went on to play keyboards in the Girls and bass in Sunday Night Blackout. After Tall Birds disbanded, Standeford started Idle Times, while Borozowski went on to form the band Black Whales. Borozowski also tours with the popular indy rock band Modest Mouse as their percussionist/ second drummer, alongside Jeremiah Green. Idle times has released two seven- inches, and Black Whales have an EP on Mt Fuji Records and a self- released full- length album. Mason's band the Girls are on Dirtnap Records.

            "The Man Who Knew Too Much is a 1956 American suspense thriller film directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock, starring James Stewart and Doris Day. The film is Hitchcock's second film using this title following his own 1934 film of the same name featuring a significantly different plot and script. In the book- length interview\" Hitchcock/ Truffaut\"( 1967), in response to fellow filmmaker Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied\" Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional.\" The film won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for\" Que Sera, Sera( Whatever Will Be, Will Be)\", sung by Doris Day. It premiered at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival on April 29.",
            "Man on Wire is a 2008 British- American biographical documentary film directed by James Marsh. The film chronicles Philippe Petit's 1974 high- wire walk between the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center. It is based on Petit's book,\" To Reach the Clouds\", released in paperback with the title\" Man on Wire\". The title of the film is taken from the police report that led to the arrest( and later release) of Petit, whose performance had lasted for almost one hour. The film is crafted like a heist film, presenting rare footage of the preparations for the event and still photographs of the walk, alongside re-enactments( with Paul McGill as the young Petit) and present- day interviews with the participants, including Barry Greenhouse, an insurance executive who served as the inside man. \" Man on Wire\" competed in the World Cinema Documentary Competition at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Prize: World Cinema Documentary and the World Cinema Audience Award: Documentary. In February 2009, the film won the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film, the Independent Spirit Awards, and the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature."

            "Blurt is a music print magazine and online outlet originally based in Silver Spring, MD. The magazine was originally known as \"Harp Magazine\" for over 10 years, also based in Silver Spring, and was considered one of the best music magazines of the decade in the early 2000s. After \"Harp\" folded in March 2008 (at the behest of its parent company, which also owned JazzTimes, it declared bankruptcy), \"Blurt\" was founded by \"Harp\" owner Scott Crawford. Some of the main writers and editors for \"Harp\" also started \"Blurt\" with Crawford, including managing editor Fred Mills (of Asheville, NC, and also a contributing editor to \"StereophileMagnet\" and other music industry publications and alternative weeklies), senior editor Randy Harward (also an editor for the Salt Lake City weekly paper), and senior editor Andy Tennille (a journalist and photographer, currently the photographer for Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers). \"Blurt\"s tag line is \"Real Music, Real Artists, Real OpinionsBlurt\" is a highly respected outlet within the music industry and has often been cited by critics and fans as the \"Mojo\" magazine of the United States. It initially launched as an all-digital, downloadable online magazine, publishing five issues in that format before moving to print for the next nine issues while also posting each issue online, frequently with expanded content, at BlurtOnline.com. In early 2010, Crawford sold the \"Blurt\" assets to Stephen Judge of Second Motion Entertainment and the company moved to the label's home of Carrboro, NC. Second Motion Entertainment also owns the record label Second Motion Records which works with such artists as Australia's The Church, Bettie Serveert, Swervedriver, Parson Red Heads and Tommy Keene. \"Blurt\" magazine announced in February 2012 that it would be relocating its offices (along with Second Motion) to Raleigh, NC, where Judge had purchased long-tenured independent record store Schoolkids Records. Editor Mills also relocated to Raleigh, assisting Judge in both running the store and publishing the magazine. As of April 2017, Schoolkids also operates locations in Durham, NC, and Carrboro, NC, and the Second Motion Records name has been changed to Schoolkids Records. The magazine, label and stores are increasingly integrated, operationally. \"Blurt\" is updated daily with new music interviews, essays and features; music news, record release announcements (vinyl is a specialty), and tour dates; exclusive videos, audio streams and bootleg MP3s; record, DVD, book and concert reviews; and blog entries by Judge, Mills, John B. Moore, Michael Toland, and Bill Kopp. Tim Hinely, founder of \"Dagger\", a punk and indie zine first published in 1987 and still in print, and recognized by \"Pitchfork\" as \"one of the best,\" is also a contributor. As a print magazine it was distributed throughout the United States and internationally. The final print issue was #14, published at the end of 2013 and featuring Artist of the Year Jason Isbell on the cover, along with features on The Beatles, Big Star, The Replacements, Megafaun, Tommy Keene and King Khan. At that point the magazine decided to revert to publishing online in the face of declining advertising revenue. While operating as a print publication, covers were devoted to artists such as: Sonic Youth, The Avett Brothers, PJ Harvey, Of Montreal, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Spiritualized Grizzly Bear and Wilco. From 2010 to 2016 the magazine also hosted an annual day party each March in Austin at the SXSW Music Festival at the Ginger Man Pub, and photo galleries and descriptions of those parties can be viewed at the Blurtonline.com website.",

            "J( oh) an and Jacob van Huchtenburg( Hughtenburg or Hugtenburg( h)) were two Dutch Golden Age painters in the second half of the seventeenth century. Both brothers were natives of Haarlem, moved to Paris, but died in Amsterdam. The main source about their lives is from Arnold Houbraken. Some of the information from the 19th century is contradictive. Jacob van Huchtenburg( 1644, Haarlem- bur. January 8, 1675, Amsterdam) studied under Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem. In 1662 he went to Italy and stayed in Rome until 1667. On his way back to Holland he stayed in Paris for more than a year, where he probably met up with his brother Jan. In 1669 he joined the Haarlem artists' guild. His pictures are probably confounded with those of his brother. He became well- to- do and lived on Prinsengracht. One is in the Brukenthal Museum, Sibiu. Jan van Huchtenburg( bapt. November 20, 1647, Haarlem- bur. July 2, 1733, Amsterdam), was a famous Dutch horse and battle painter, like Esaias van de Velde and Philip Wouwermans. He was first taught by Thomas Wijck. On his way to visit his brother in Rome, he may not have got further than Paris, where he served under Antony Francis van der Meulen in the Manufacture des Gobelins employing him for illustrating, sketching or designing. In 1670 he settled at Haarlem, where he married Elisabeth Mommes. It seems he practised and kept a dealers shop in Haarlem or in the Hague. His style had now merged into an imitation of Wouwerman and Van der Meulen, which could not fail to produce pretty pictures of hunts and robber camps, the faculty of painting horses and men in action and varied dress being the chief point of attraction. Huchtenburg assisted Gerrit Berckheyde and painted his people and horses. Later Huchtenburg ventured on cavalry skirmishes and engagements of regular troops generally, and these were admired by Prince Eugene of Savoy and King William III, who gave the painter sittings, and commissioned him to throw upon canvas the chief incidents of the battles they fought upon the continent of Europe. When he died at Bloemgracht in the Jordaan in 1733, Huchtenburg had done much by his pictures and prints to make Prince Eugene, King William and Marlborough popular. Though clever in depicting a mile or a skirmish of dragoons, he remained second to Philip Wouvermans in accuracy of drawing, and inferior to Van der Meulen in the production of landscapes. But, nevertheless, he was a clever and spirited master, with great facility of hand and considerable natural powers of observation. The earliest date on his pictures is 1674, when he executed the Stag- Hunt in the Museum of Berlin, and the Fight with Robbers in the Liechtenstein Museum at Vienna. A Skirmish at Fleurus( 1690) in the Brussels gallery seems but the precursor of larger and more powerful works, such as the Siege of Namur( 1695) in the Belvedere at Vienna, where William III is seen in the foreground accompanied by Max Emmanuel, the Bavarian elector. Three years before, Huchtenburg had had sittings from Prince Eugene and William III. After 1696 he regularly served as court painter to Prince Eugene, and we have at[ a] Galleria Sabauda a series of ten or eleven canvases, all of the same size depicting the various battles of the great hero, commencing with the Battle of Zenta( 1697), Battle of Chiari( 1701), Battle of Luzzara( 1702), Battle of Blenheim( 1704), Battle of Cassano( 1705), Battle of Turin( 1706), Battle of Oudenaarde( 1708), Battle of Malplaquet( 1709), Battle of Petrovaradin( 1716) ending with the Battle of Belgrade( 1717). Had the Duke of Marlborough been fond of art he would doubtless have possessed many works of our artist. All that remained in 1911 at Blenheim Palace, however, was a couple of sketches of battles, which were probably sent to Churchill by his great contemporary. In 1911, the pictures of Huchtenburg were not very numerous in public galleries. There was one in the National Gallery, London, another at the Louvre. But Copenhagen had four, Dresden six, Gotha two, and Munich had the well- known composition of Tallart taken Prisoner at Blenheim in 1704.",

            "Gran Torino is a 2008 American drama film directed and produced by Clint Eastwood, who also starred in the film. The film co-stars Christopher Carley, Bee Vang and Ahney Her. This was Eastwood's first starring role since 2004's \"Million Dollar Baby\". The film features a large Hmong American cast, as well as one of Eastwood's younger sons, Scott. Eastwood's oldest son, Kyle, provided the score. Set in Detroit, Michigan, it is the first mainstream American film to feature Hmong Americans. Many Lao Hmong war refugees resettled in the U.S. following the communist takeover of Laos in 1975. The story follows Walt Kowalski, a recently widowed Korean War veteran alienated from his family and angry at the world. Walt's young neighbor, Thao Vang Lor, is pressured by his cousin into stealing Walt's prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino for his initiation into a gang. Walt thwarts the theft with his M1 Garand rifle and subsequently develops a relationship with the boy and his family. \"Gran Torino\" opened in a limited theatrical release in the United States on December 12, 2008, before expanding wide on January 9, 2009. It grossed $270 million worldwide (making it Eastwood's second highest-grossing film to-date). Within the Hmong community in the United States, the film received praise for Eastwood\u2019s direction and performance, but also received criticism for its portrayal of Asian stereotypes.",

            "Walter E. Massey( born April 5, 1938) is an American educator, physicist, and executive. He is president emeritus of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago( SAIC) since 2018 and previously served as its president beginning in 2010 and chancellor in 2016. He is also chairman of the board overseeing construction of the Giant Magellan Telescope, and serves as trustee chair of the City Colleges of Chicago. Massey's career had earlier seen him serve for over 10 years as president of Morehouse College. He is also a former head of the National Science Foundation, managing director of Argonne National Laboratory, and chairman of Bank of America. He has served in professorial and administrative posts at the University of California, University of Chicago, Brown University, and the University of Illinois. Throughout his more than forty years of professional life, Massey has been guided by two overarching principles: first, that science and technology are necessary to sustain the nation's quality of life and the standard of living of its citizens; and, second, that the general public's understanding of science and technology is a critical component of a democratic society. Massey's commitment to these principles has, among other areas of advocacy, additionally led him to be a proponent of the need for a strong system of national science education, as well as the need to enhance the representation of women and minorities in science and technology. Massey has focused on arts and design education at the college and K- 12 levels, working to improve student access to the arts and to highlight the important role they play in fostering student creativity and achievement. Massey is particularly interested in the intersections between the arts and sciences and in the ways broad exposure to both prepares students for future success and contributes to a more creative and dynamic society. Reflecting his diverse array of experience, Massey is the only individual to serve as both President and Chairman of the American Association for the Advancement of Science( AAAS) and as Chair of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design( AICAD). Additionally, Massey is the only individual to have received both the Enrico Fermi Award for Science and Technology from the Chicago Historical Society and the Public Humanities Award from Illinois Humanities.",

            "Charles Taze Russell( February 16, 1852 \u2013 October 31, 1916), or Pastor Russell, was an American Christian restorationist minister from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and founder of what is now known as the Bible Student movement. After his death, Jehovah's Witnesses and numerous independent Bible Student groups developed from this base. In July 1879, Russell began publishing a monthly religious journal,\" Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence\". In 1881 he co-founded Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society with William Henry Conley as president; in 1884 the corporation was officially registered, with Russell as president. Russell wrote many articles, books, tracts, pamphlets and sermons, totaling approximately 50,000 printed pages. From 1886 to 1904, he published a six- volume Bible study series originally titled\" Millennial Dawn\", later renamed\" Studies in the Scriptures\", nearly 20 million copies of which were printed and distributed around the world in several languages during his lifetime. ( A seventh volume was commissioned by his successor as society president, Joseph Rutherford, and published in 1917.) The Watch Tower Society ceased publication of Russell's writings in 1927, though his books are still published by several independent groups. After Russell's death, a crisis arose surrounding Rutherford's leadership of the society, culminating in a movement- wide schism. As many as three- quarters of the approximately 50,000 Bible Students who had been associating in 1917 had left by 1931. This shift resulted in the formation of several groups that retained variations on the name\" Bible Students\". Those who maintained fellowship with the Watch Tower Society adopted the name\" Jehovah's witnesses\" in 1931, while those who severed ties with the Society formed their own groups including the Pastoral Bible Institute in 1918, the Laymen's Home Missionary Movement in 1919, and the Dawn Bible Students Association in 1929.",

            "Maria Dul\u0119bianka( 21 October 1861 \u2013 7 March 1919) was a Polish artist and activist. Born into a family of landed gentry, she attended finishing school in Krak\u00f3w and then studied art in Warsaw and in Vienna and Paris. Her work was recognized in the 1900 Paris Exposition and her\" Studium dziewczyny\"( Girls' Studio) was purchased by the National Museum in Krak\u00f3w. After 1889, the majority of her paintings were of her companion Maria Konopnicka. Dul\u0119bianka was active in the women's movement pressing for women to be admitted to the Krak\u00f3w Academy of Fine Arts and for the establishment of a gymnasium in Lviv for girls to gain access to higher education. She published articles and gave lectures on women's issues. Active in the fight for women's suffrage, she ran as a candidate in the 1908 election for the Parliament of Galicia, but was rejected because she was a woman. Undiscouraged, she continued to strive for social equality, Polish independence, and cooperation between Poles and Ukrainians. Dul\u0119bianka founded the Women's Electoral Committee to press for women's inclusion in the Lviv City Council, the Union of Women's Rights, the Men's League for the Defense of Women's Rights and the Women's Civic Work Committee. As the leader of the Civic Work Committee, she established kitchens for the poor, children's nurseries, and a club to care for street children and orphans. Under the occupation of Lviv by the Imperial Russian Army and during the Polish \u2013 Ukrainian War, she organized humanitarian aid. She contracted typhus while assisting prisoners of war and died in 1919. Dul\u0119bianka is remembered as a pioneer of women's rights in Poland."

            "The Pride and the Passion is a 1957 Napoleonic era war film in Technicolor and VistaVision from United Artists, produced and directed by Stanley Kramer, that stars Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, and Sophia Loren. The film co-stars Theodore Bikel and Jay Novello. The film's storyline concerns a British Royal Navy artillery officer( Grant) who has orders to retrieve a huge siege cannon from Spain and transport it by ship to British forces. But first, the leader of the Spanish guerrillas( Sinatra) wants to transport the weapon 1,000 km across Spain to help in the recapture of the city of \u00c1vila from the occupying French before he releases it to the British. Most of the film deals with the hardships of transporting the big gun to \u00c1vila across rivers and through mountains, while also evading the occupying French forces that have been ordered to find it. A subplot concerns the struggle for the love of the Spanish woman Juana( Loren) by the two male protagonists. The screen story and screenplay by Edna Anhalt and Edward Anhalt was loosely based on the 1933 novel\" The Gun\" by C. S. Forester. Earl Felton did an uncredited screenplay re-write, George Antheil composed the music score, while Saul Bass designed the opening title sequence. The film's music score was the last important work by George Antheil, once famous as the\" bad boy of music\" in the 1920s. It is the only one of Antheil's many film scores to have been preserved on a commercial soundtrack recording.",

                    "Flowerdew's success can be attributed to the very strict grading of language, which enables young readers to steadily and cumulatively build confidence, her storytelling ability and an eye for interesting material.",

Hunt was born as Archie Albert Hunt in Terrell, Texas to Archibald Hunt and Manasa Emma Lee Skates, both of whom were blues musicians. As a child, he learned to play the fiddle by stealing his father's instrument and self- teaching himself in a nearby graveyard. Though much of Hunt's personal life is obscure, it is known he served in the First World War, and his first professional work as a musician was as a member in a traveling minstrel show, in the early 1920s.

It is set in the world of American professional football. The plot involves a love triangle between the characters portrayed by Reynolds, Kristofferson, and Clayburgh. \" Semi-Tough\" also includes a parody of Werner Erhard's Erhard Seminars Training (\"est\"), depicted in the film as an organization called \"B.E.A.T.\" The film is based on the novel of the same name by Dan Jenkins. It was adapted for the screen by writer Walter Bernstein and director Ritchie, who added a new storyline that included a satire of the self-help movement and new religions. \"Semi-Tough\" follows the story of pro football friends Billy Clyde Puckett and Marvin \"Shake\" Tiller, who have a third roommate, Barbara Jane Bookman. A romance develops with Shake until he becomes self-confident after completing a self awareness course called \"B.E.A.T.\" led by Friedrich Bismark that he insists Barbara Jane try, at which point Billy Clyde slyly makes a play to win her for himself.
